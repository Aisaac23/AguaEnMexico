# Agua en México

This is my first personal project using Python, after taking a course about Python for data analysis and getting and Edx certification in Python for data science.

It is aimed to visualize data about the precipitation in Mexico. 

- The project has the following features:
	- Function that performs the data pre-processing step which takes plain text files with the data and converts them into ready-to use CSV files.(Example: Aguascalientes-ten-years-totals.png) 
	- Function that allows you to visualize the annual precipitation measurements of a specific state (e.g. Aguascalientes).
	- Function to get a line plot for every year in your collected data (up to 10), displaying the precipitation measurements by month for a specific state. (Example: Aguascalientes-ten-years-by-month.png)

	- Interactive bar plot that allows you to visualize the total precipitation per year in all the 32 states at the same time and compare those measurements with other years'. (Example: Precipitación_anual_de_todos_los_estados_de_México_(interactivo).png)

The data was taken from this national official site: https://smn.conagua.gob.mx/es/climatologia/temperaturas-y-lluvias/resumenes-mensuales-de-temperaturas-y-lluvias
